## 📌 Overview

### 1. Key Idea

* 🎯 **Goal**: Build an end‑to‑end customer‑segmentation workflow based on purchasing data so that businesses can personalise marketing and optimise resources.
* 🔍 **Scope**: Data cleaning, RFM feature engineering, **K‑Means** clustering, selecting the optimal number of clusters via **Silhouette** Score and Elbow Curve, visualising results, and turning insights into business strategy.

### 2. Main Outcomes

* Identified **4** distinct customer clusters with clear purchasing‑behaviour differences.
* Delivered actionable recommendations: retain loyal customers, activate prospects, re‑engage lapsed users, and more.

### I. Why This Project Matters

1. Cuts marketing costs by targeting the right audience.
2. Increases **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** through tailored offers.
3. Anticipates needs and lifts customer experience.

### II. Technical Roadmap

1. **Collect & clean data**
2. **Descriptive analysis & RFM**
3. **Scale features and decide optimal *K*** (Elbow, Silhouette)
4. **Train K‑Means**
5. **Evaluate & visualise clusters**
6. **Translate analytics into business actions**

### III. Results & Evaluation

| Cluster | Key Traits                          | Suggested Strategy                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | High spend, frequent purchases      | Loyalty programme, exclusive perks                 |
| 1       | Recent buyers, low order value      | Upsell accessories, product bundles                |
| 2       | Infrequent buyers, low order value  | Re‑engagement email, discount vouchers             |
| 3       | High order value, long purchase gap | Personalised recommendations, replenishment nudges |

<!-- Comment 2: Add metrics (e.g. Silhouette = 0.54) to back up cluster validity. -->

### 📌 Summary

> Customer segmentation lets businesses **focus resources** on the most profitable groups while **improving the experience** for the entire customer base.

### IV. Future Work

* Experiment with DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models.
* Automate the pipeline using Kedro or Airflow.
* Build a real‑time dashboard.
